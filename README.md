The dataset consists records of 1436 used Toyota corollas of various models. Each model has unique 35 features. Based on the data, Predictive models are built based on Regression algorithm i.e. Decision Tree and Random forest models. These models can help to estimate the selling price of a car based on its features. Such an estimation can be useful for the company or agent while investing in an old automobile. Strategies and planning can be done based on the estimated selling price to make profits and to avoid investing in loose deals.

Random forest regressor model performs better than the others,  resulting MAPE=8.192350550833881, R2 score=0.9171389306342687. After parameters tuning, results are further improved to MAPE=8.01232197613188, R2 score=0.9238987153042665.

Decision Tree models gives MAPE=10.560149453349563, R2-score=0.8527003525436305. After tuning the parameters, MAPE=9.277403649133817, R2 score=0.8795475859497024
